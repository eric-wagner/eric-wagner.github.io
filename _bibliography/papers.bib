  abstract = {Protecting industrial control systems against cyberattacks is crucial to counter escalating threats to critical infrastructure. To this end, Industrial Intrusion Detection Systems (IIDSs) provide an easily retrofittable approach to uncover attacks quickly and before they can cause significant damage. Current research focuses either on maximizing automation, usually through heavy use of machine learning, or on expert systems that rely on detailed knowledge of the monitored systems. While the former hinders the interpretability of alarms, the latter is impractical in real deployments due to excessive manual work for each individual deployment. To bridge the gap between maximizing automation and leveraging expert knowledge, we introduce GeCo, a novel IIDS based on automatically derived comprehensible models of benign system behavior. GeCo leverages state-space models mined from historical process data to minimize manual effort for operators while maintaining high detection performance and generalizability across diverse industrial domains. Our evaluation against state-of-the-art IIDSs and datasets demonstrates GeCo’s superior performance while remaining comprehensible and performing on par with expert-derived rules. GeCo represents a critical step towards empowering operators with control over their cybersecurity toolset, thereby enhancing the protection of valuable physical processes in industrial control systems and critical infrastructures.},

  abstract = {Controller Area Networks (CANs) are the backbone for reliable intra-vehicular communication. Recent cyberattacks have, however, exposed the weaknesses of CAN, which was designed without any security considerations in the 1980s. Current efforts to retrofit security via intrusion detection or message authentication codes are insufficient to fully secure CAN as they cannot adequately protect against masquerading attacks, where a compromised communication device, a so-called electronic control units, imitates another device. To remedy this situation, multicast source authentication is required to reliably identify the senders of messages. In this paper, we present CAIBA, a novel multicast source authentication scheme specifically designed for communication buses like CAN. CAIBA relies on an authenticator overwriting authentication tags on-the-fly, such that a receiver only reads a valid tag if not only the integrity of a message but also its source can be verified. To integrate CAIBA into CAN, we devise a special message authentication scheme and a reactive bit overwriting mechanism. We achieve interoperability with legacy CAN devices, while protecting receivers implementing the AUTOSAR SecOC standard against masquerading attacks without communication overhead or verification delays.},

The idea is simple: Instead of appending an authentication tag to each message in a communication stream, the integrity protection of multiple messages is aggregated into a single tag. Recent studies postulate, e.g., based on simulations, that these benefits also spread to wireless, and thus lossy, scenarios despite each lost packet typically resulting in the loss of integrity protection information for multiple messages. In this paper, we investigate these claims in a real deployment. Therefore, we first design a MAC aggregation extension for the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) 1.3 protocol. Afterward, we extensively evaluate the performance of MAC aggregation on a complete communication protocol stack on embedded hardware. We find that MAC aggregation can indeed increase goodput by up to 50 % and save up to 17 % of energy expenditure for the transmission of short messages, even in lossy channels.},

Countermeasures in the system-under-test are often left out of the cyber resilience evaluation phase. We propose CERERE-an automated framework designed to measure and test the cyber resilience of complex IT systems, such as critical national infrastructure and military networks. CERERE simulates the effects of attacks on the system regardless of exploitation methods. The framework consists of war gaming exercises where attacker and defender modules interact in a simulated test environment to allow a dynamic evaluation of resilience. The attacker module uses heuristic algorithms to generate kill chains, while the defender module leverages AI-based algorithms to simulate defense strategies. CERERE has been validated by evaluating the resilience of a given scenario and identifying the optimal configuration of responses and countermeasures},

However, traditional end-to-end security protocols interfere with the necessary access to in-flight data. While recent work on middlebox-aware end-to-end security protocols for the traditional Internet promises to address the dilemma between end-to-end security guarantees and middleboxes, the current state-of-the-art lacks critical features for industrial communication. Most importantly, industrial settings require fine-grained access control for middleboxes to truly operate in a least-privilege mode. Likewise, advanced applications even require that middleboxes can inject specific messages (e.g., emergency shutdowns). Meanwhile, industrial scenarios often expose tight latency and bandwidth constraints not found in the traditional Internet. As the current state-of-the-art misses critical features, we propose Middlebox-aware DTLS (Madtls), a middlebox-aware end-to-end security protocol specifically tailored to the needs of industrial networks. Madtls provides bit-level read and write access control of middleboxes to communicated data with minimal bandwidth and processing overhead, even on constrained hardware.},

However, while such aggregation saves bandwidth, a single lost message typically means that authentication information for multiple messages cannot be verified anymore. With the significant increase of bandwidth-constrained lossy communication, as applications shift towards wireless channels, it thus becomes paramount to study the impact of packet loss on the diverse MAC aggregation schemes proposed over the past 15 years to assess when and how to aggregate message authentication. Therefore, we empirically study all relevant MAC aggregation schemes in the context of lossy channels, investigating achievable goodput improvements, the resulting verification delays, processing overhead, and resilience to denial-of-service attacks. Our analysis shows the importance of carefully choosing and configuring MAC aggregation, as selecting and correctly parameterizing the right scheme can, e.g., improve goodput by 39 % to 444 %, depending on the scenario. However, since no aggregation scheme performs best in all scenarios, we provide guidelines for network operators to select optimal schemes and parameterizations suiting specific network settings.},

While the existing literature proposes effective IIDS solutions evaluated in controlled environments, their deployment in real-world industrial settings poses several challenges. Adding to known obstructions, this paper highlights two critical aspects that significantly impact IIDSs’ practical deployment, i.e., the need for sufficient amounts of data to train the IIDS models and the challenges associated with finding suitable hyperparameters, especially for IIDSs training only on normal ICS data. Through empirical experiments conducted on multiple state-of-the-art IIDSs and diverse datasets, we establish the criticality of these issues in deploying IIDSs in ICS environments. Our findings show the necessity of extensive malicious training data for supervised IIDSs, which can be impractical considering the complexity of recording and labeling attacks in actual ICSs. Furthermore, while other IIDSs circumvent the previous issue by requiring only benign training data, these can suffer from the difficulty of setting appropriate hyperparameters, which likewise can diminish their performance. By shedding light on these challenges, we aim to enhance the current understanding of limitations and considerations necessary for deploying effective cybersecurity solutions in ICSs, which might be one reason why IIDSs see few deployments.},

As security processing requires significant time, the goals of secure communication and low latency contradict each other. Especially on constrained IoT devices, which are equipped with cheap, low-power processors, the overhead for security processing aggregates to a primary source of latency. We show that antedated encryption and data authentication with templates enables IoT devices to meet both, security and low latency requirements. These mechanisms offload significant security processing to a preprocessing phase and thus decrease latency during actual transmission by up to 75.9 %.

In this paper, we introduce SmartJudge, an extensible generalization of this trend for smart contract-based two-party protocols. SmartJudge relies on a protocol-independent mediator smart contract that moderates two-party interactions and only consults protocol-specific verifier smart contracts in case of a dispute. This way, SmartJudge avoids verification costs in absence of disputes and sustains interaction confidentiality among honest parties. We implement verifier smart contracts for cross-blockchain trades and exchanging digital goods and show that SmartJudge can reduce costs by 46-50% and 22% over current state of the art, respectively.},

In this paper, we thus investigate QWIN, a novel approach that leverages this cooperative nature by enabling the stations to share the scarce transmission resources. The stations hence offload their priority queues into the network and share them according to the quality-of-service requirements imposed by the overlying industrial applications. We implemented the cooperation mechanisms on prototypical hardware and evaluated them in a real-world testbed and by simulations. The evaluation reveals that our distributed decision approach effectively ensures that higher priority messages are conveyed more reliably within 1ms, without reducing the reliability of lower priority messages.},

Our key idea is to offload resource-intensive computations to idle phases and thus save valuable time in latency-critical phases, i.e., when new data awaits processing. Therefore, BP-MAC leverages a universal hash function designed for the bitwise preprocessing of integrity protection to later only require a few XOR operations during the latency-critical phase. Our evaluation on embedded hardware shows that BP-MAC outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of latency and memory overhead, notably for small messages, as required to adequately protect resource-constrained devices with stringent security and latency requirements.},

However, to achieve this goal, message authentication considerably expands packet sizes, which is especially problematic in constrained wireless environments. To address this issue, progressive message authentication provides initially reduced integrity protection that is often sufficient to process messages upon reception. This reduced security is then successively improved with subsequent messages to uphold the strong guarantees of traditional integrity protection. However, contrary to previous claims, we show in this paper that existing progressive message authentication schemes are highly susceptible to packet loss induced by poor channel conditions or jamming attacks. Thus, we consider it imperative to rethink how authentication tags depend on the successful reception of surrounding packets. To this end, we propose R2-D2, which uses randomized dependencies with parameterized security guarantees to increase the resilience of progressive authentication against packet loss. To deploy our approach to resource-constrained devices, we introduce SP-MAC, which implements R2-D2 using efficient XOR operations. Our evaluation shows that SP-MAC is resilient to sophisticated network-level attacks and operates as resources-conscious and fast as existing, yet insecure, progressive message authentication schemes.},

As manually creating these behavioral models is tedious and error-prone, research focuses on machine learning to train them automatically, achieving detection rates upwards of 99 %. However, these approaches are typically trained not only on benign traffic but also on attacks and then evaluated against the same type of attack used for training. Hence, their actual, real-world performance on unknown (not trained on) attacks remains unclear. In turn, the reported near-perfect detection rates of machine learning-based intrusion detection might create a false sense of security. To assess this situation and clarify the real potential of machine learning-based industrial intrusion detection, we develop an evaluation methodology and examine multiple approaches from literature for their performance on unknown attacks (excluded from training). Our results highlight an ineffectiveness in detecting unknown attacks, with detection rates dropping to between 3.2 % and 14.7 % for some types of attacks. Moving forward, we derive recommendations for further research on machine learning-based approaches to ensure clarity on their ability to detect unknown attacks.},

  abstract = {Shipboard marine radar systems are essential for safe navigation, helping seafarers perceive their surroundings as they provide bearing and range estimations, object detection, and tracking. Since onboard systems have become increasingly digitized, interconnecting distributed electronics, radars have been integrated into modern bridge systems. But digitization increases the risk of cyberattacks, especially as vessels cannot be considered air-gapped. Consequently, in-depth security is crucial. However, particularly radar systems are not sufficiently protected against harmful network-level adversaries. Therefore, we ask: Can seafarers believe their eyes? In this paper, we identify possible attacks on radar communication and discuss how these threaten safe vessel operation in an attack taxonomy. Furthermore, we develop a holistic simulation environment with radar, complementary nautical sensors, and prototypically implemented cyberattacks from our taxonomy. Finally, leveraging this environment, we create a comprehensive dataset (RadarPWN) with radar network attacks that provides a foundation for future security research to secure marine radar communication.},

  abstract = {Cyberattacks against industrial control systems pose a serious risk to the safety of humans and the environment. Industrial intrusion detection systems oppose this threat by continuously monitoring industrial processes and alerting any deviations from learned normal behavior. To this end, various streams of research rely on advanced and complex approaches, i.e., artificial neural networks, thus achieving allegedly high detection rates. However, as we show in an analysis of 70 approaches from related work, their inherent complexity comes with undesired properties. For example, they exhibit incomprehensible alarms and models only specialized personnel can understand, thus limiting their broad applicability in a heterogeneous industrial domain. Consequentially, we ask whether industrial intrusion detection indeed has to be complex or can be SIMPLE instead, i.e., Sufficient to detect most attacks, Independent of hyperparameters to dial-in, Meaningful in model and alerts, Portable to other industrial domains, Local to a part of the physical process, and computationally Efficient. To answer this question, we propose our design of four SIMPLE industrial intrusion detection systems, such as simple tests for the minima and maxima of process values or the rate at which process values change. Our evaluation of these SIMPLE approaches on four state-of-the-art industrial security datasets reveals that SIMPLE approaches can perform on par with existing complex approaches from related work while simultaneously being comprehensible and easily portable to other scenarios. Thus, it is indeed justified to raise the question of whether industrial intrusion detection needs to be inherently complex.},

  abstract = {The increasing interconnection of industrial networks exposes them to an ever-growing risk of cyber attacks. To reveal such attacks early and prevent any damage, industrial intrusion detection searches for anomalies in otherwise predictable communication or process behavior. However, current efforts mostly focus on specific domains and protocols, leading to a research landscape broken up into isolated silos. Thus, existing approaches cannot be applied to other industries that would equally benefit from powerful detection. To better understand this issue, we survey 53 detection systems and find no fundamental reason for their narrow focus. Although they are often coupled to specific industrial protocols in practice, many approaches could generalize to new industrial scenarios in theory. To unlock this potential, we propose IPAL, our industrial protocol abstraction layer, to decouple intrusion detection from domain-specific industrial protocols. After proving IPAL’s correctness in a reproducibility study of related work, we showcase its unique benefits by studying the generalizability of existing approaches to new datasets and conclude that they are indeed not restricted to specific domains or protocols and can perform outside their restricted silos.},

The growing digitalization and networking in power grids combined with insufficient protection against cyberattacks further exacerbate this trend. Hence, security engineers and researchers must counter these new risks by continuously improving security measures. Data sets of real network traffic during cyberattacks play a decisive role in analyzing and understanding such attacks. Therefore, this paper presents PowerDuck, a publicly available security data set containing network traces of GOOSE communication in a physical substation testbed. The data set includes recordings of various scenarios with and without the presence of attacks. Furthermore, all network packets originating from the attacker are clearly labeled to facilitate their identification. We thus envision PowerDuck improving and complementing existing data sets of substations, which are often generated synthetically, thus enhancing the security of power grids.},

Cybersecurity research thus continuously needs to adapt to new threats while proposing comprehensive security mechanisms for the ICS domain. As a prerequisite, researchers need to understand the resilience of ICSs against cyberattacks by systematically testing new security approaches without interfering with productive systems. Therefore, one possibility for such evaluations is using already available ICS testbeds and datasets. However, the heterogeneity of the industrial landscape poses great challenges to obtaining comparable and transferable results. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap with METRICS, a methodology for systematic resilience evaluation of ICSs. METRICS complements existing ICS testbeds by enabling the configuration of measurement campaigns for comprehensive resilience evaluations. Therefore, the user specifies individual evaluation scenarios consisting of cyberattacks and countermeasures while facilitating manual and automatic interventions. Moreover, METRICS provides domain-agnostic evaluation capabilities to achieve comparable results, which user-defined domain-specific metrics can complement. We apply the methodology in a use case study with the power grid simulator Wattson, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing valuable insights for security practitioners and researchers.},

  abstract = {Industrial systems are increasingly threatened by cyberattacks with potentially disastrous consequences. To counter such attacks, industrial intrusion detection systems strive to timely uncover even the most sophisticated breaches. Due to its criticality for society, this fast-growing field attracts researchers from diverse backgrounds, resulting in 130 new detection approaches in 2021 alone. This huge momentum facilitates the exploration of diverse promising paths but likewise risks fragmenting the research landscape and burying promising progress. Consequently, it needs sound and comprehensible evaluations to mitigate this risk and catalyze efforts into sustainable scientific progress with real-world applicability. In this paper, we therefore systematically analyze the evaluation methodologies of this field to understand the current state of industrial intrusion detection research. Our analysis of 609 publications shows that the rapid growth of this research field has positive and negative consequences. While we observe an increased use of public datasets, publications still only evaluate 1.3 datasets on average, and frequently used benchmarking metrics are ambiguous. At the same time, the adoption of newly developed benchmarking metrics sees little advancement. Finally, our systematic analysis enables us to provide actionable recommendations for all actors involved and thus bring the entire research field forward.},

Consequently, the vast landscape of legacy industrial communication protocols urgently demands a universal solution to integrate security features retroactively. However, current proposals are hardly adaptable to new scenarios and protocols, even though most industrial protocols share a common theme: Due to their progressive development, previously important legacy features became irrelevant and resulting unused protocol fields now offer a unique opportunity for retrofitting security. Our analysis of three prominent protocols shows that headers offer between 36 and 63 bits of unused space. To take advantage of this space, we designed the REtrofittable ProtEction Library (RePeL), which supports embedding authentication tags into arbitrary combinations of unused header fields. We show that RePeL incurs negligible overhead beyond the cryptographic processing, which can be adapted to hit performance targets or fulfill legal requirements.},

Unsupervised anomaly detectors, capable of learning the expected behavior of physical processes, have proven effective in detecting even novel cyberattacks. While offering decent attack detection, these systems, however, still suffer from too many False-Positive Alarms (FPAs) that operators need to investigate, eventually leading to alarm fatigue. To address this issue, in this paper, we challenge the notion of relying on a single IIDS and explore the benefits of combining multiple IIDSs. To this end, we examine the concept of ensemble learning, where a collection of classifiers (IIDSs in our case) are combined to optimize attack detection and reduce FPAs. While training ensembles for supervised classifiers is relatively straightforward, retaining the unsupervised nature of IIDSs proves challenging. In that regard, novel time-aware ensemble methods that incorporate temporal correlations between alerts and transfer-learning to best utilize the scarce training data constitute viable solutions. By combining diverse IIDSs, the detection performance can be improved beyond the individual approaches with close to no FPAs, resulting in a promising path for strengthening ICS cybersecurity.},
